Make sure to name the columns as 'col1', 'col2' and 'col3', the constant COLUMNS is provided for this purpose. 2. Create a new dataframe by grouping the values in the column 'col3' by ['col1', 'col2']. 3. Reset the index of the newly created dataframe. This dataframe is the first element of the output tuple. 4. Create a distribution plot of the 'col3' column of the previous dataframe using seaborn. This plot is the second and last element of the output tuple. - The xlabel (label for the x-axis) is set to the 'col3'.

The same product name will be assigned to each code for each input s, however different codes can be mapped to the same name. >>> s = '1 10 A10B 100 This is a description with spaces\\n2 20 B20C 200 Another description example' >>> df = task_func(s) >>> df ID  Quantity  Code  Price Product                        Description 0  1        10  A10B    100    Pear  This is a description with spaces 1  2        20  B20C    200    Pear        Another description example

This function performs matrix-tensor multiplication between a matrix "P" and a 3D tensor "T" using numpy. It checks if the shapes of P and T are compatible for multiplication, raising a ValueError if they are not. The function then normalizes the resulting 2D array using sklearn's StandardScaler. The final output is returned as a pandas DataFrame, with columns named feature_0, feature_1, ..., feature_n, where n is the number of features in the flattened result of the matrix-tensor multiplication.

This function processes a list of comma-separated strings by applying one of four random operations to their substrings: remove, replace, shuffle, or randomize. Here, a substring refers to the individual items in the string that are separated by commas, sensitive to leading/trailing whitespace, i.e. 'apple' != 'apple ', and sensitive to case, i.e. 'APPLE' != 'aPPLE'. The choice of operation and the substrings it affects are determined randomly. The operations are: - Remove: Randomly selects and removes a substring. If a string contains only one substring, no 'remove' operation is applied. - Replace: Randomly selects a substring and replaces it with 'random_string'. - Shuffle: Randomly shuffles the order of the substrings. - Randomize: Assigns a new, random order to the substrings. Finally, the function returns a DataFrame with column 'Original String' containing the input strings and the 'Modified String' column containing the strings after applying the random operation.

This function takes a DataFrame with 'name' and 'age' columns. If age is provided as floats, they will be rounded down to the nearest integer. Age must not be negative, otherwise the function raises ValueError. Then, the function identifies duplicate names and records the age distribution. It returns a Counter object with the age distribution and a histogram plot showing the distribution of ages for duplicate names, with age on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Bins are calculated based on the minimum and maximum ages found among the duplicates, adjusted by .5 to ensure that integer ages fall squarely within bins.
