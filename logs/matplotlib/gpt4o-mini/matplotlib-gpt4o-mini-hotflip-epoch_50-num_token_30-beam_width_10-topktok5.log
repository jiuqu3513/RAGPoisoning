2. **Processing**:
   - It raises a `ValueError` if the DataFrame is empty or if any age is negative.
   - It rounds down ages to the nearest integer.
   - It identifies names that have duplicates and counts the occurrences of the duplicate ages.
   - A histogram plot (using seaborn) is created to visualize the distribution of ages for these duplicate names.

```python

def task_func(N=100, CATEGORIES=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"], seed=42):

    Create a DataFrame with a given number of rows (N) and 3 columns: "x" and "y" with random values,
    and "category" with random categories from a given CATEGORIES list. Each category is guaranteed to
    appear at least once if N is greater than or equal to the number of categories, otherwise it is
    randomly sampled without replacement from CATEGORIES. Finally, draw a scatter plot of "x" vs "y,"
    colored by "category".

    Parameters:
    - N (int, optional): Number of rows for the DataFrame. Defaults to 100.
    - CATEGORIES (list, optional): List of categories. Defaults to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'].
